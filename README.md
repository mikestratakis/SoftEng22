Group: SoftEng22-84

## Purpose of Project <br/>
The purpose of the intelliQ platform is to design and execute "intelligent questionnaires". <br/>
A questionnaire is characterized as "intelligent" when each subsequent question and its answers can be determined by the answer to the previous one.<br>
Both the questions and the answers and the transition rules are defined parametrically, i.e. the user has the ability to give the options and paths and as a result the software is initialized and executed.
